        "To reduce the number of summaries, one idea is to group columns by their header names across tables. However, even with the same header, the values and surrounding context of that column could differ, leading to different interpretations. So relying only on column names might ignore important differences.\n",

        "However, it could still be interesting for generalization. If multiple summaries are generated for the same column name, we could try a self-consistency approach by selecting the most frequent one. This might be useful when there's no clear ground truth, like when inferring column types or generating summaries. It's a probably a direction worth exploring if time allows. Or naively generate one to potentially save time and costs."

We break the summarization task into smaller subtasks to produce a more representative description of each table, essentially as an attempt to divert from standard greedy decoding and its token distribution biases (also by setting the model parameters to deviate from greedy decoding). Inspired by self-consistency methods, we generate stepwise summaries of table contents and aggregate them into a final summary, aiming for a more accurate representation to support document expansion and information retrieval.\n",

Het merendeel van het gemaaide gras wordt, in de vorm van kuilgras en hooi, gebruikt als wintervoedering voor de koeien, een klein deel is bestemd voor zomerstalvoedering en voor andere doeleinden. Verder wordt ook de voorraad kuilgras en hooi aan het einde van het jaar (het begin van de stalperiode voor de koeien) vermeld. Gegevens zijn vanaf 1985 beschikbaar voor Nederland totaal en vanaf 1993 ook voor vijf landbouwregio's. Tot en met 2017 werden de cijfers jaarlijks (overwegend) vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Per 2018 worden de cijfers van melkveehouders vastgesteld op basis van informatie uit de database van de KringloopWijzer. Deze database is in beheer van ZuivelNL. De cijfers van niet-melkveehouders worden vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Met ingang van 2022 worden de cijfers van zowel melkveehouders als niet-melkveehouders vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Met ingang van 2018 wordt natuurlijk grasland met een landbouwfunctie meegenomen in de vaststelling van de oppervlakte en de opbrengst van grasland. Hierdoor is de totale oppervlakte en opbrengst grasland in Nederland ten opzichte van 2017 toegenomen. Met ingang van 2021 is de methode voor berekening van de grasopbrengst bijgesteld. Was tot en met 2020 de hoogste toegestane opbrengst 15.000 kg droge stof per hectare, in 2021 is dit 20.000 kg per hectare. Status van de cijfers: de cijfers tot en met 2021 zijn definitief. Wijzigingen per 14 september 2023: De cijfers van 2021 zijn definitief geworden. De voorlopige cijfers over 2022 zijn toegevoegd. Wanneer komen er nieuwe cijfers?

Het bevat gegevens over kuilgrasproductie, verwerking van grasland tot zomerstalvoedering en percentages van graslandgebruik voor diverse doeleinden.\",\n          \"Werkloosheidsduur; per kwartaal en jaar Deze tabel bevat cijfers over de werkloosheidsduur van de werkloze beroepsbevolking van 15 tot 75 jaar. Hiermee is het mogelijk het aantal kort- en langdurig werklozen te bepalen. Kortdurig werklozen zijn korter dan 12 maanden werkloos. Langdurig werklozen zijn 12 maanden of meer werkloos. De cijfers in de tabel kunnen worden uitgesplitst naar geslacht, leeftijd en onderwijsniveau. De tabel bevat zowel kwartaal- als jaarcijfers. Het CBS gaat over op een nieuwe indeling van de bevolking naar herkomst. Voortaan is meer bepalend waar iemand zelf geboren is, naast waar iemands ouders geboren zijn. Daarbij wordt het woord migratieachtergrond niet meer gebruikt. De hoofdindeling westers/niet-westers wordt vervangen door een indeling op basis van werelddelen en veelvoorkomende immigratielanden. Deze indeling wordt geleidelijk ingevoerd in tabellen en publicaties met bevolking naar herkomst. Voor deze StatLinetabel is besloten dat de herkomstindeling komt te vervallen. Gegevens beschikbaar vanaf: 2013 Status van de cijfers: De cijfers in deze tabel zijn definitief. Wijzigingen per 14 november 2023: De cijfers over het 3e kwartaal 2023 zijn toegevoegd. Wijzigingen per 14 februari 2023: De cijfers over het 4e kwartaal en de jaarcijfers over 2022 zijn toegevoegd. In eerdere tabellen was de niet meer gebruikte migratieachtergrond opgenomen. Deze is uit de tabel verwijderd. Wijzigingen per 17 augustus 2022: Geen, dit is een nieuwe tabel. Deze tabel is samengesteld op basis van de Enqu\\u00eate Beroepsbevolking (EBB). Vanwege wijzigingen in het onderzoeksdesign en de vragenlijst van de EBB zijn de cijfers over 2021 niet zonder meer vergelijkbaar met de cijfers tot en met 2020. De kerncijfers in deze tabel zijn daarom consistent gemaakt met de (niet-seizoengecorrigeerde) cijfers in de tabel Arbeidsdeelname, kerncijfers seizoengecorrigeerd (zie paragraaf 4), waarin de uitkomsten voor de periode 2013-2020 zijn herberekend om aan te sluiten op de uitkomsten vanaf 2021. Bij verdere detaillering van de uitkomsten naar baan- en persoonskenmerken kunnen er van 2020 op 2021 desondanks verschillen zijn als gevolg van de nieuwe methode. Wanneer komen er nieuwe cijfers? Nieuwe cijfers worden gepubliceerd op 14 februari 2024.

Specifieke vragen die beantwoord kunnen worden zijn onder andere het aantal werkloze personen met een middelbaar opleidingsniveau in het vierde kwartaal van 2014 en het aantal jongeren dat 1 tot 3 maanden werkloos was in 2017. Ook informatie over werkloosheid onder mensen met een hoge opleiding is beschikbaar.\",\n          \"Verkeersdeelname; persoonskenmerken Deze tabel bevat informatie over het verplaatsingsgedrag van de Nederlandse bevolking van 6 jaar of ouder in particuliere huishoudens, dus exclusief bewoners van instellingen, inrichtingen en tehuizen. De tabel bevat het verplaatsingsgedrag uitgesplitst naar het aandeel verkeersdeelname en aandeel deelname aan het openbaar vervoer verdeeld naar persoonskenmerken, populatie en geslacht. Het gaat om reguliere verplaatsingen op Nederlands grondgebied inclusief binnenlandse vakantiemobiliteit en serieverplaatsingen op Nederlands grondgebied. De cijfers zijn berekend met het onderzoek Onderweg in Nederland (ODiN). Dat is de opvolger van het onderzoek Verplaatsingen in Nederland (OViN; 2010-2017). Het ODiN is ten opzichte van het voorafgaande OViN op diverse punten in belangrijke mate gewijzigd en de onderzoeken zijn daarom onderling niet volgtijdelijk vergelijkbaar.

Het merendeel van het gemaaide gras wordt, in de vorm van kuilgras en hooi, gebruikt als wintervoedering voor de koeien, een klein deel is bestemd voor zomerstalvoedering en voor andere doeleinden. Verder wordt ook de voorraad kuilgras en hooi aan het einde van het jaar (het begin van de stalperiode voor de koeien) vermeld. Gegevens zijn vanaf 1985 beschikbaar voor Nederland totaal en vanaf 1993 ook voor vijf landbouwregio's. Tot en met 2017 werden de cijfers jaarlijks (overwegend) vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Per 2018 worden de cijfers van melkveehouders vastgesteld op basis van informatie uit de database van de KringloopWijzer. Deze database is in beheer van ZuivelNL. De cijfers van niet-melkveehouders worden vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Met ingang van 2022 worden de cijfers van zowel melkveehouders als niet-melkveehouders vastgesteld uit de resultaten van de enqu\\u00eate Graslandgebruik. Met ingang van 2018 wordt natuurlijk grasland met een landbouwfunctie meegenomen in de vaststelling van de oppervlakte en de opbrengst van grasland. Hierdoor is de totale oppervlakte en opbrengst grasland in Nederland ten opzichte van 2017 toegenomen. Met ingang van 2021 is de methode voor berekening van de grasopbrengst bijgesteld. Was tot en met 2020 de hoogste toegestane opbrengst 15.000 kg droge stof per hectare, in 2021 is dit 20.000 kg per hectare. Status van de cijfers: de cijfers tot en met 2021 zijn definitief. Wijzigingen per 14 september 2023: De cijfers van 2021 zijn definitief geworden. De voorlopige cijfers over 2022 zijn toegevoegd. Wanneer komen er nieuwe cijfers? Uiterlijk in het derde kwartaal verschijnen de voorlopige cijfers van het voorafgaande jaar en krijgen de cijfers van een jaar eerder een definitieve status.

Deze gegevens worden verbijzonderd naar positie in de werkkring en uitgesplitst naar geslacht, leeftijd, onderwijsniveau en positie in het huishouden. Gegevens beschikbaar vanaf: 2013 Status van de cijfers: De cijfers in deze tabel zijn definitief, alleen de inkomenscijfers van 2021 zijn voorlopig. Wijzigingen per 30 juni 2023: De voorlopige inkomenscijfers voor 2020 worden vervangen door definitieve. Daarnaast worden voorlopige inkomenscijfers voor 2021 toegevoegd. Het CBS gaat over op een nieuwe indeling van de bevolking naar herkomst. Voortaan is meer bepalend waar iemand zelf geboren is, naast waar iemands ouders geboren zijn. Daarbij wordt het woord migratieachtergrond niet meer gebruikt. De hoofdindeling westers/niet-westers wordt vervangen door een indeling op basis van werelddelen en veelvoorkomende immigratielanden. Deze indeling wordt geleidelijk ingevoerd in tabellen en publicaties met bevolking naar herkomst. Voor deze StatLinetabel is besloten dat de herkomstindeling komt te vervallen. Wijzigingen per 17 augustus 2022: Geen, dit is een nieuwe tabel. Deze tabel is samengesteld op basis van de Enqu\\u00eate Beroepsbevolking (EBB). Vanwege wijzigingen in het onderzoeksdesign en de vragenlijst van de EBB zijn de cijfers over 2021 niet zonder meer vergelijkbaar met de cijfers tot en met 2020. De kerncijfers in deze tabel zijn daarom consistent gemaakt met de (niet-seizoengecorrigeerde) cijfers in de tabel Arbeidsdeelname, kerncijfers seizoengecorrigeerd (zie paragraaf 4), waarin de uitkomsten voor de periode 2013-2020 zijn herberekend om aan te sluiten op de uitkomsten vanaf 2021. Bij verdere detaillering van de uitkomsten naar baan- en persoonskenmerken kunnen er van 2020 op 2021 desondanks verschillen zijn als gevolg van de nieuwe methode. Wanneer komen er nieuwe cijfers? De nieuwe cijfers komen een jaar na afloop van het verslagjaar beschikbaar. Het gaat dan om voorlopige cijfers. Deze worden twee jaar na afloop van het verslagjaar definitief. Persoonlijk (primair) en gestandaardiseerd inkomen, werkzamen Geslacht, positie werkkring, arbeidsduur en persoonskenmerken Werkzame beroepsbevolking; gemiddeld inkomen besteedbare inkomens ['Werkzame beroepsbevolking', 'Gemiddeld inkomen', 'Tijdelijke contracten', 'Zelfstandige ondernemers', 'Zelfstandige docenten', 'Leeftijdscategorie\\u00ebn', 'Uren per week', 'Jaartallen'] Deze tabel kan geraadpleegd worden indien men informatie zoekt over de werkzame beroepsbevolking, gemiddelde inkomens, tijdelijke contracten, zelfstandige ondernemers en docenten, verdeeld over verschillende leeftijdscategorie\\u00ebn, aantal gewerkte uren per week en jaartallen. Het bevat specifieke data zoals het aantal mensen met tijdelijke contracten die minder dan 20 uur per week werken in bepaalde jaren en leeftijdsgroepen.\",\n          \"Bouwvergunningen woonruimten; eigendom In deze tabel worden gegevens gepubliceerd over de geschatte bouwkosten en het aantal nieuw te bouwen woonruimten waarvoor de verleende bouwvergunning is gemeld bij het CBS. De uitkomsten hebben betrekking op verleende bouwvergunningen met een bouwsom vanaf 50 duizend euro, exclusief BTW. De gegevens zijn uitgesplitst naar type opdrachtgever, naar type woonruimte (woning, wooneenheid en recreatiewoning), naar het soort eigendom (huur- en koopwoningen) en naar gemeenten. Omdat deze tabel uitsluitend de gerespondeerde gegevens van de gemeenten bevat, sluit deze tabel niet aan bij andere gepubliceerde tabellen over de bouwvergunningen, er is daarom voor gekozen om niet te aggregeren naar bovengemeentelijke indelingen zoals provincie en landsdeel. Gegevens beschikbaar vanaf januari 2012. Status van de cijfers: De cijfers over 2012 t/m het derde kwartaal 2022 zijn definitief. De cijfers vanaf het vierde kwartaal van 2022 zijn voorlopig. Deze tabel bevat alleen de gerespondeerde gegevens zoals ontvangen van de gemeenten. Gemeenten met non-respons worden niet geschat. Nagekomen opgaven van gemeenten over voorgaande perioden zijn verwerkt in de cijfers van de maand waarin de vergunning is verleend. Hierdoor kunnen cijfers over eenzelfde maand in de loop der tijd vari\\u00ebren. Twaalf maanden na publicatie wordt het voorlopige cijfer definitief vastgesteld. Wijzigingen per 16 november 2023: De cijfers van het derde kwartaal 2022 zijn definitief gemaakt. De cijfers van het derde kwartaal 2023 zijn toegevoegd. De voorlopige cijfers van het vierde kwartaal 2022 tot en met het tweede kwartaal 2023 kunnen enigszins verschillen met de vorige publicatie. Wanneer komen er nieuwe cijfers? De nieuwe cijfers worden circa 2 maanden na de verslagperiode gepubliceerd. De cijfers over hetzelfde kwartaal van een jaar eerder worden dan definitief. Bouwkosten, woonsector opdrachtgever, eigendom, gemeente Bouwvergunningen woonruimten; type, opdrachtgever, eigendom, gemeente gemeenten ['Bouwvergunningen woonruimten', 'bouwkosten', 'opdrachtgever', 'eigendom', 'gemeente'] Deze tabel kan geraadpleegd worden indien men informatie zoekt over bouwvergunningen voor woonruimten, inclusief bouwkosten, opdrachtgever, eigendom en gemeente. Voorbeelden van vragen die deze tabel kan beantwoorden zijn: bouwkosten voor huurwoningen in Beesel in het 4e kwartaal van 2014, aantal woonruimte bouwvergunningen in 2013 in Deventer, totaal aantal bouwvergunningen voor woonruimten opdrachtgever Wijchen 3e kwartaal 2021, en meer.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"column_summaries\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"schema_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 494,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"De kolom ID vertegenwoordigt: De kolom \\\"ID\\\" lijkt te verwijzen naar unieke identificatienummers die elke rij in de tabel hebben gekregen. Deze nummers kunnen waarschijnlijk worden gebruikt om individuele records of observaties in de dataset te onderscheiden. Ze hebben geen directe betekenis voor de inhoud van de data, maar dienen meer functioneel als sleutels voor de organisatie en ordening van de gegevens. \\n\\nEen mogelijke interpretatie is dat deze IDs corresponderen met een combinatie van factoren zoals regio, periode en soortelijk onderzoek, waarbij elk getal uniek is binnen deze combinatie. De kolom RegioS vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'RegioS' lijkt te verwijzen naar regio's in Nederland waarin landbouwactiviteiten plaatsvinden. De voorbeelden 'GG02', 'GG04' en 'GG01' suggereren dat ze referenties zijn naar specifieke gebiedscode of provincies in Nederland. \\n\\nEchter, zonder meer concrete informatie over de betekenis van deze codes, kan ik slechts concluderen dat ze waarschijnlijk regionale aanduidingen zijn. De kolom Perioden vertegenwoordigt: De kolom \\\"Perioden\\\" lijkt te vertegenwoordigen de periode waarvoor de gegevens gelden. De waarden in deze kolom hebben de vorm \\\"jaar-jaartype\\\", waarbij \\\"jaar\\\" het kalenderjaar aangeeft en \\\"jaartype\\\" een code aangeeft om te onderscheiden tussen verschillende periodes binnen \\u00e9\\u00e9n kalenderjaar.\\n\\nEen paar voorbeelden:\\n* \\\"2023JJ00\\\" zou kunnen betekenen dat de gegevens gaan over het eerste kwartaal van 2023.\\n* \\\"2021JJ00\\\" zou kunnen betekennen dat de gegevens gaan over het hele jaar 2021.\\n* \\\"1987JJ00\\\" zou kunnen betekenen dat de gegevens gaan over het tweede halfjaar van 1987.\\n\\nHet is echter niet duidelijk hoe precies de codes in de kolom \\\"Perioden\\\" zijn samengesteld, dus deze interpretatie is slechts een mogelijke uitleg. De kolom TotaleOppervlakteGrasland_1 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'TotaleOppervlakteGrasland_1' vertegenwoordigt de totale oppervlakte van grasland in een bepaald gebied of regio. In het voorbeeld worden getallen genoemd zoals 218,0, 166,0 en 234,0, die waarschijnlijk de oppervlakten in hectares vertegenwoordigen. De kolom TotaleGemaaideOppervlakteGrasland_2 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom \\\"TotaleGemaaideOppervlakteGrasland_2\\\" vertegenwoordigt de totale oppervlakte van gemaaid grasland in een bepaald gebied of regio. In het voorbeeld worden waarden genoemd zoals 491,0, 1979,0 en 229,0, die aangeven dat deze getallen representatief zijn voor de oppervlaktes van gemaaid grasland in respectievelijk 1985, 1993 en 1993 (jaargangen waarvoor data beschikbaar is). De kolom Kuilgras_3 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom \\\"Kuilgras_3\\\" vertegenwoordigt de productie of hoeveelheid kuilgras in tonnen droge stof per hectare. In het voorbeeld worden waarden getoond die tussen 84,0 en 87,0 tonnen liggen, wat aangeeft dat het gaat om de hoeveelheid kuilgras geproduceerd per hectare grassland. De kolom Hooi_4 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Hooi_4' vertegenwoordigt de hoeveelheid hooi dat beschikbaar is. De waarden in deze kolom lijken te refereren naar duizenden tonnen of kilotonnen hooi, aangezien ze getallen tussen 2,0 en 6,0 zijn. \\n\\nEchter zonder meer informatie over de exacte betekenis van de getallen in de kolom 'Hooi_4' is het moeilijk om precies te zeggen welke eenheden hierbij worden gebruikt. Mogelijk verwijzen ze naar kilogrammen, tonnen of zelfs nog grotere hoeveelheden hooi. De kolom Zomerstalvoedering_5 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Zomerstalvoedering_5' vertegenwoordigt de hoeveelheid grasland dat wordt gebruikt voor zomerstalvoedering. Dit betekent dat een deel van het grasland wordt beweid gedurende de zomermaanden om voedsel te produceren voor dieren die in de zomer buiten staan. De kolom Overig_6 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Overig_6' lijkt te vertegenwoordigen het percentage of hoeveelheid grasland dat wordt gebruikt voor doelen die buiten de hoofdcategorie\\u00ebn zoals kuilgras, hooi en zomerstalvoeding vallen. In het voorbeeld zijn de waarden 3.0, 4.0 en 8.0 genoemd, maar geen expliciete omschrijving is geleverd. Mogelijk gaat het om percentages of absolute hoeveelheden grasland dat wordt gebruikt voor onder meer beweidingsdoeleinden, begrazing door dieren of ander gebruik dat niet in de hoofdkolommen is vermeld. De kolom TotaleOogstKuilgras_7 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'TotaleOogstKuilgras_7' vertegenwoordigt de totale oogst van kuilgras in tonnen droge stof per hectare. \\n\\nHet getal tussen haakjes ([4803.0]) staat hierbij voor een waarde die niet relevant is voor de vraag naar de betekenis van de kolom. De kolom MetDrogeStofgehalte35Procent_8 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'MetDrogeStofgehalte35Procent_8' lijkt te verwijzen naar de hoeveelheid droge stof die in het grasland aanwezig is met een droge stofgehalte van 35%. De waarden in deze kolom lijken echter geen directe betekenisvolle waarde te hebben, maar kunnen wellicht dienen als input of referentiemateriaal voor een rekeningssysteem. \\n\\nEchter, op grond van de tabelbeschrijving is het niet duidelijk wat de exacte betekenis is van deze kolom. Een meer gedetailleerde omschrijving zou noodzakelijk zijn om de precieze inhoud ervan te begrijpen. De kolom MetDrogeStofgehalte35Procent_9 vertegenwoordigt: Ik kon geen duidelijke omschrijving vinden voor de kolom 'MetDrogeStofgehalte35Procent_9'. De naam suggereert dat het percentage droge stof in het gras zou kunnen aanduiden die boven of onder de 35% ligt, maar zonder verdere uitleg kan ik geen betrouwbare beschrijving geven. \\n\\nDaarnaast zijn de voorbeelden die je noemt (83.0, 93.0, 77.0) niet expliciet genoeg om te concluderen welk type gegeven ze precies vertegenwoordigen. De kolom TotaleOogstHooi_10 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'TotaleOogstHooi_10' vertegenwoordigt de totale oogst van hooi per hectare grasland. In andere woorden, het gaat om de hoeveelheid hooi dat wordt geproduceerd op \\u00e9\\u00e9n hectare grasland. De kolom VoorraadKuilgras_11 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'VoorraadKuilgras_11' vertegenwoordigt de voorraad kuilgras in tonnen droge stof. De kolom VoorraadHooi_12 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'VoorraadHooi_12' vertegenwoordigt de hoeveelheid hooivoorraad in droge stof die aan het einde van het jaar beschikbaar is voor gebruik als voeding voor koeien of voor andere doelen. In het gegeven voorbeeld worden getallen tussen 32,0 en 117,0 kg droge stof genoemd, maar geen exacte omschrijving voor de eenheid.\",\n          \"De kolom ID vertegenwoordigt: Er is geen expliciete omschrijving of uitleg gegeven over de betekenis van de kolom \\\"ID\\\" in de tabel. Op basis van de beschrijving van de tabel lijkt het echter waarschijnlijk dat de \\\"ID\\\"-kolom unieke identificatienummers toewijst aan elk record in de tabel. Dit zou ervoor zorgen dat elke rij in de tabel uniek kan worden ge\\u00efdentificeerd op basis van haar ID. \\n\\nEchter, er is geen concrete bewijs hiervoor in de tekst, dus ik zal het antwoord geven als: \\\"Unieke identificatienummer\\\". De kolom Geslacht vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Geslacht' lijkt te verwijzen naar een codering of code die wordt gebruikt om het geslacht van personen in de werkzame beroepsbevolking aan te geven. \\n\\nEchter, zonder verdere uitleg of toelichting over de gebruikte codes, is het lastig om precies te zeggen welke waarden elk geslacht aanduiden. In het gegeven voorbeeld ('T001038') lijkt het echter geen standaardcode te zijn, maar eerder een unieke identifier of referenti\\u00eble code. \\n\\nEen mogelijke interpretatie is dat 'T001038' een uniek identificatienummer is dat gekoppeld is aan een bepaald individu of groep met een bepaald geslacht. De kolom Arbeidsduur vertegenwoordigt: Ik kan geen exacte omschrijving vinden van de kolom \\\"Arbeidsduur\\\" in de tekstuele context. \\n\\nEchter, ik zie wel dat er in de tabel een kolom staat genaamd \\\"Uren per week\\\" ('['werkzame_beroepsbevolking', 'gemiddeld inkomen', 'tijdelijke contracten', 'zelfstandige ondernemers', 'zelfstandige docenten', 'leeftijdscategorie\\u00ebn', 'uren per week', 'jaartallen']'). Dit suggereert dat de kolom \\\"Arbeidsduur\\\" waarschijnlijk verwant is aan de hoeveelheid tijd dat personen werken per week. \\n\\nHet zou echter beter zijn om rechtstreeks contact op te nemen met de bronverantwoordelijke of de databasebeheerder om precieze uitleg over de inhoud en interpretatie van de kolom \\\"Arbeidsduur\\\" te verkrijgen. De kolom Persoonskenmerken vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Persoonskenmerken' lijkt te refereren aan unieke identificatienaam of code voor elk individu binnen de tabel. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarden zoals '1015150', '1016430' en '53800'suggereren dat deze waarden codes of id's zijn voor verschillende categorie\\u00ebn of groepen personen. Mogelijk betreffen ze categorisaties zoals opleidingsniveaus, sociaaleconomische statussen, etniciteit, etc., maar hierover kan geen uitsluitsel worden gegeven met de beschikbare informatie. De kolom PositieInDeWerkkring vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'PositieInDeWerkkring' lijkt te vertegenwoordigen een unieke code of identifier voor verschillende posities binnen de werkkring. De voorbeelden die je geeft ('2021346', '2021340', 'A050414') suggereren dat deze codes waarschijnlijk zijn opgebouwd uit meerdere delen, zoals een landcode of regio-code, een sectorcode of industrie-code, en/of een type-positie-code.\\n\\nEchter, zonder meer informatie over de structuur of betekenis van deze codes, kan ik slechts vermoeden dat ze een manier zijn om de verschillende posities binnen de werkkring te categoriseren. De kolom Perioden vertegenwoordigt: \\\"Geen beschrijving\\\". \\n\\nIk heb geen informatie gevonden over de betekenis van de kolom 'Perioden'. Mogelijk geeft het CBS hier niet expliciet uitleg over of ik heb de juiste bronnen nog niet gevonden. De kolom WerkzameBeroepsbevolking_1 vertegenwoordigt: Het lijkt alsof de beschrijving van de kolom 'WerkzameBeroepsbevolking_1' niet expliciet genoemd wordt in de tekstuele context. \\nEchter, aangezien de naam van de kolom \\\"WerkzameBeroepsbevolking\\\" is, kun je vermoeden dat deze kolom verwijst naar het aantal personen in de werkzame beroepsbevolking. \\n\\nDit zou betekenen dat deze kolom het aantal personen weergeeft die binnen een bepaald tijdperk actief waren in de arbeidsmarkt. In het voorbeeld zijn de waarden 722, 2442 en 1227, maar ik heb geen informatie gevonden over hoe deze exacte getallen worden verkregen of wat ze precies betekenen. De kolom WerkzameBeroepsbevolkingMetInkomen_2 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'WerkzameBeroepsbevolkingMetInkomen_2' lijkt te vertegenwoordigen het aantal personen binnen de werkzame beroepsbevolking die een inkomen hebben. De waarden in deze kolom zouden mogelijke aantallen of percentages weergeven van personen die een inkomen hebben, maar exacte betekenis zou nader moeten worden verklaard uit andere bronnen of contextuele informatie. De kolom GemiddeldPersoonlijkPrimairInkomen_3 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'GemiddeldPersoonlijkPrimairInkomen_3' vertegenwoordigt het gemiddelde primaire inkomen per persoon van de werkzame beroepsbevolking. Dit betekent dat de waarde in deze kolom het gemiddelde bedrag is dat personen hebben ontvangen als hun primaire bron van inkomen, bijvoorbeeld salaris of pensioen, exclusief eventuele secundaire inkomensbronnen. De kolom GemiddeldPersoonlijkInkomen_4 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'GemiddeldPersoonlijkInkomen_4' vertegenwoordigt het gemiddelde persoonlijke inkomen van de werkzame beroepsbevolking. Dit betekent dat de kolom toont hoe hoog het gemiddelde inkomen is van alle personen die actief zijn op de arbeidsmarkt, exclusief de institutionele bevolking. De waarden in deze kolom geven dus aan hoeveel geld het gemiddelde individu ontvangt vanuit hun werk. De kolom GemiddeldGestandaardiseerdInkomen_5 vertegenwoordigt: Het gemiddelde gestandaardiseerde inkomen vertegenwoordigt het gemiddelde inkomen van de werkzame beroepsbevolking, aangepast aan de sociale stelsels en belastingtarieven van Nederland. Dit geeft een indicatie van de re\\u00eble koopkracht van het inkomen. De kolom WerkzameBeroepsbevolkingInkOnbekend_6 vertegenwoordigt: \\\"Geen beschrijving\\\". \\n\\nEr staat niets over de betekenis of inhoud van deze kolom in de tekst.\",\n          \"De kolom ID vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'ID' lijkt te refereren aan unieke identificaties of codes voor elk record in de tabel. Het geeft waarschijnlijk aan dat elke rij in de tabel een uniek element represents. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarden als 6312, 4425 en 9875 suggereren dat dit een numerieke code is, maar zonder verdere context is het moeilijk om precies te zeggen wat deze codes exact representeren. \\n\\nIn veel datasets gebruiken ontwikkelaars IDs om records te onderscheiden en te verwijzen, dus het is waarschijnlijk dat deze kolom gebruikmaakt van een dergelijk systeem. De kolom Opdrachtgever vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Opdrachtgever' vertegenwoordigt de identificator of code van de opdrachtgever van de bouwwerkzaamheden. Het geeft aan wie de opdracht heeft gegeven voor de nieuwbouw van de woonruimten. In dit geval lijken de codes ('T001209') waarschijnlijk referenties of unieke identificators voor specifieke organisaties of entiteiten. De kolom Eigendom vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Eigendom' lijkt te verwijzen naar een code of identificator voor het soort eigendom van de woning of woonruimte. Het geeft aan welke categorie de woning of woonruimte onder valt, maar de exacte inhoud van deze kolom is niet duidelijk zonder verdere context. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarde 'T001258' zou dus waarschijnlijk moeten corresponderen met een specifieke categorisering binnen dit systeem van eigendomssoorten. De kolom RegioS vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'RegioS' lijkt te corresponderen met gemeentecodes. De voorbeelden die je geeft ('GM0244', 'GM0060', 'GM0498') zijn namelijk allemaal codes die gelijkend op gemeentecodes zijn. Dit zou dus aangeven dat elke regelspecifieke waarde in deze kolom een uniek identificatienummer of code voor een specifiek gebied (gemeente) representeert. De kolom Perioden vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Perioden' lijkt te vertegenwoordigen de periodes of tijdperken waarover de gegevens in de tabel gaan. Het geeft aan welke kwartalen of jaren de data betreffen. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarden als '2021KW03' en '2012KW03' suggereren dat deze waarden verwijzen naar specifieke kwartalen binnen een jaar, namelijk respectievelijk het derde kwartaal van 2021 en het derde kwartaal van 2012. Waarbij 'KW' staat voor kwartal en het getal daarna de positie van het kwartaal in dat jaar aangeeft (van 01 voor januari tot 04 voor oktober). \\n\\nEchter, zonder verdere context, kan dit slechts een redelijke conclusie zijn. De kolom BouwkostenGebouwbestemmingWoonsector_1 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom \\\"BouwkostenGebouwbestemmingWoonsector_1\\\" lijkt te vertegenwoordigen de geschatte bouwkosten van nieuwbouwwoningen. De waarden in deze kolom lijken de gemiddelde of geschatte kosten per woning te weergeven. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarden:\\n- 3954,0 euro per woning \\n- 1310,0 euro per woning\\n- 640,0 euro per woning De kolom Woningen_2 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Woningen_2' vertegenwoordigt het aantal nieuw te bouwen woningen waarvoor de verleende bouwvergunning is gemeld. \\n\\nVoorbeeldwaarden:\\n- 998.0 : Aantal woningen in een specifieke periode\\n- 91.0   : Aantal woningen in een andere specifieke periode\\n- 354.0  : Aantal woningen in nog een ander specifiek tijdvak De kolom Wooneenheden_3 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Wooneenheden_3' vertegenwoordigt het aantal nieuw te bouwen wooneenheden waarvoor de verleende bouwvergunning is gemeld bij het CBS. De kolom Recreatiewoningen_4 vertegenwoordigt: De kolom 'Recreatiewoningen_4' vertegenwoordigt het aantal nieuw te bouwen recreatiewoningen waarvoor de verleende bouwvergunning is gemeld bij het CBS.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"overall_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 494,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"De dataset bevat informatie over de oppervlakte en opbrengst van grasland in Nederland, gesplitst over verschillende landbouwregio's.
